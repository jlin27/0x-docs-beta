# GET /swap/v1/price

`/swap/v1/price` can be used to acquire an indicative price for a transaction.

Rather than returning a transaction that can be submitted to an Ethereum node, this resource simply indicates the pricing that would be available for an analogous call to `/swap/v1/quote`. 

Intended for use with RFQ-T; see [Indicative Pricing & Firm Quotes](/market-makers/docs/introduction#indicative-pricing) for more details.

### Request

Identical to the request schema for `/swap/v1/quote`, with a few exceptions on all supported chains:

* For `/price`, the default of `skipValidation=true` but can be overridden to `false`, whereas for `/quote`, the default of `skipValidation=false` but can be overridden to `true`
* The `intentOnFilling` field will always be undefined.

| `price`              | If `buyAmount` was specified in the request it provides the price of `buyToken` in `sellToken` and vice versa. This price does not include the `slippage` provided in the request above, and therefore represents the best possible price. <br/><br/>If `buyTokenPercentageFee` and `feeRecipientwere` set, the fee amount will be part of this returned price. If `enableSlippageProtection` in the request was not false, the `buyAmount` & `price` responses returned will factor slippage in its routing.                                                                                      |
| `estimatedPriceImpact`                 | When `priceImpactProtectionPercentage` is set, this value returns the estimated change in the price of the specified asset that would be caused by the executed swap due to [price impact(/0x-swap-api/advanced-topics/price-impact-protection)]. <br/><br/> **Note:** If we fail to estimate price change we will return `null`.  <br/><br/>**Read more** about price impact protection and how to set it up [here](/0x-swap-api/advanced-topics/price-impact-protection) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `value`              | The amount of ether (in wei) that should be sent with the transaction.

| `gasPrice`           | The gas price (in wei) that should be used to send the transaction. The transaction needs to be sent with this `gasPrice` or lower for the transaction to be successful.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `gas`                | The estimated gas limit that should be used to send the transaction to guarantee settlement. While a computed estimate is returned in all responses, an accurate estimate will only be returned if a `takerAddress` is included in the request.                                                                                  |

Always less than `gas`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `protocolFee`        | The maximum amount of ether that will be paid towards the protocol fee (in wei), and what is used to compute the `value` field of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `minimumProtocolFee` | The minimum amount of ether that will be paid towards the protocol fee (in wei) during the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `buyAmount`          | The amount of `buyToken` (in `buyToken` units) that would be bought in this swap. Certain on-chain sources do not allow specifying `buyAmount`, when using `buyAmount` these sources are excluded.                                                                                                                               |
| `sellAmount`         | The amount of `sellToken` (in `sellToken` units) that would be sold in this swap. Specifying `sellAmount` is the recommended way to interact with 0xAPI as it covers all on-chain sources.                                                                                                                                       |
| `sources`            | The percentage distribution of `buyAmount` or `sellAmount` split between each liquidity source. Ex: `[{ name: '0x', proportion: "0.8" }, { name: 'Kyber', proportion: "0.2"}, ...]`                                                                                                                                              |
| `buyTokenAddress`    | The ERC20 token address of the token you want to receive in quote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `sellTokenAddress`   | The ERC20 token address of the token you want to sell with quote.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `allowanceTarget`    | The target contract address for which the user needs to have an allowance in order to be able to complete the swap. For swaps with "ETH" as `sellToken`, wrapping "ETH" to "WETH" or unwrapping "WETH" to "ETH" no allowance is needed, a null address of `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is then returned instead. |
| `sellTokenToEthRate` | The rate between ETH and `sellToken`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `buyTokenToEthRate` | The rate between ETH and `buyToken`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `expectedSlippage` | This is the expected slippage used in routing calculations for the quote returned. It is the value of slippage that we estimate that the selected route will have: <br/><br/> - It can be used by integrators to calculate the Final Expected Amount for the asset: i.e. calculated as (`buyAmount` * `expectedSlippage` ) <br/><br/> -  It will only be returned when `enableSlippageProtection` is not set to `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
