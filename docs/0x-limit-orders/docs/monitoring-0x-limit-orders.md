# Monitoring 0x Limit Orders

The 0x API also exposes a [websocket server](/0x-orderbook-api/api-references/websocket-api) at the root endpoint. The server will allow you to subscribe to 0x Limit Order updates, and will push updates whenever the status (eg: open, filled, expired) of an order changes.
